# consumer-segment-unsupervised-learning
Use MCA, K-means, HC, K-medoid to segment lifestyles. Project with Dr. Boucher from CUHK.

## Constrcuting the space of main dimensions of lifestyle: Multiple Correspondence Analysis
 - Similar to PCA (dimensionality reduction) but on categorical variables
 
 - Visualize relational between groups of respondents with similar profiles in a space

## Classify lifestyle segments: K-means and HC combined
 - Conduct clustering on principal dimensions returned by MCA

## Verify structural homology: Overlay of clusters on the MCA
 - First on lifestyle segments, then on socio-economic segments to see the level of overlay

## What's next?
 - Account for geographical variation, local neighbourhood and culture, etc.
 
 - Measurement of lifestyle: health habit, housing condition, leisure and travel, etc.
 
 - A multi-ladder model
